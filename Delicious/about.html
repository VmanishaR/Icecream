            <h3>home made ice creams for you</h3>
            <p> Delicious KMA IceCream is another Indian dessert parlor, concentrated on serving surface-driven little group frozen yogurts with a recharged consideration regarding flavor and sense of taste. Proprietor and originator build up every 
                formula explicitly for every individual flavor.</p>
                <p>The uprightness of his fixings is never traded off with added substances or handled balancing out. “Each frozen yogurt is made considering the flavor profile first.” With this hands-on methodology, the owner hopes to change the manner in which individuals eat and consider this nostalgic treat, by giving dessert
                 darlings a completely unique and contemporary frozen yogurt encounter.</p>
